## Research Description
Using a corpus of linguistic data gathered from college-aged students, the goal of my research is to find patterns in the speech of students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and to compare their speech with the speech of students with typical development (TD).

The corpus used in this research is not available to the public, and thus is not included in this project.

## Researh Goals
* Insert utterance boundaries, timestamps, and speaker indicators.
* Gather metrics from the data.
* Analyze said metrics.
* Develop an annotation scheme.

## Researh Paper
Once my research is made public, a link to the official research paper will be available [here]().

## Project Description
CLAAP is a command-line application designed to make it easy for linguists (both computer-oriented and non-computer-oriented) to use the [Natural Language Tool Kit](http://www.nltk.org/) (NLTK) for analyzing virtually any text file.

CLAAP is designed to help you annotate text files and it is assumed that most input files will not be already annotated. In order for CLAAP to function properly, you should ensure that the input files that you provide do not contain any annotations. Because there are so many variations of linguistic annotation schemes, it would simply be impossible to account for all of them in the initial parsing of input files; it is easier for you to remove any existing annotations than it is for me to do so.

## System Requirements
Currently, CLAAP has only been tested on 64-bit Ubuntu 15.04 with Python 2.7.9.

## Installation
Ensure that Python is installed on your machine.

Run the following in a command line.
    
    bash ./setup.sh

## Project Goals
* Develop a command-line interface.
* Provide basic metric gathering features.
* Provide basic annotation insertion features.
* Provide filename aliasing.
* Create a script for installing dependencies.
